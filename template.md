# Summary
[summary]: #summary

One para explanation of the feature.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

# Guide-level explanation

How does this affect public Rayon APIs? If this is purely an
implementation detail, it's ok to note that it doesn't affect Rayon
users very much.

# Implementation notes

Describe at a high-level details of the implementation. This doesn't
have to be super detailed; e.g., if we are adding a new
`ParallelIterator` API, it it probably fine to leave some of this up
to the Rayon PR. It is also fine to open a PR on the Rayon repository
and link it to this RFC (and vice versa).

# Rationale and alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

# Unresolved questions

Anything left unresolved that we'll need to work out and evaluation
during implementation? Feel free to leave this section blank if you
can't think of anything.  "
